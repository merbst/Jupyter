# Jupyter
Frameworks for Web Scripting &amp; Data Visualization
This project collects the full set of features & platforms in the form of DebianLive  ISOÂ  images for deployment identically configured softwre development environments across devices &amp; Operating Systems, as a proot filesystem or virtualized.
LinuxRoot images generated with selected modules including Jupyter GTK Consoles &amp; Notebooks providing: Julia, Python, Pandas ... SageMath, SymPy, SciPy, Rpy2, pyPhi, numpy with separate GitHub projects developing an Android APK installer &amp; VirtualBox OVA Images to provide consistnt near-identical user interfaces across platforms, by the wonder of virtualization.
In the future, I hope to provide a corresponding virtualized server brick image to make some use of the Infiniband cluster I built in my garage.
